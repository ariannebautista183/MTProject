    <h2>About Bacarra</h2>
    <p>
      The town of Bacarra was founded by Augustinians on 18 September 1590, headed by Fr. Benito Mena who was a native of Vigan. The church dates back to the 16th century. Construction was supervised by Fray Felipe Fernandez of the Order of Saint Augustine. When the first building was destroyed, it was rebuilt in 1700 and was finished by 1706 headed by Fray Diego de Mendrosqueta, Fray Miguel Abiol and Fray Antonio de Villanueva. The church was damaged by an earthquake the following year and later by yet another one. The present church was rebuilt by Fray Juan Martin that was dated around the middle of the 19th century.

    <h2>Bacarra Bell Tower</h2>
    <p>
      Old Spanish-Baroque churches and bell towers have been among the most visited tourist destinations in the Philippines where majority are Catholics. Undeniably, every proud Catholics in every town take pride in their stunningly beautiful churches and the stories behind it, just like how the Bacarreños are proud of theirs.Bacarra treasures the early 19th century Torre Ti Bacarra, or Bacarra Tower that once towered over all the bell towers in the Philippine islands. With the tower’s original design, a 16 x 16 meter base and at 50 meters high, it once reigned as the highest bell tower in the Philippine islands until it was trembled by 2 earthquakes that brought down the top most level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though not the highest anymore, curious travelers still drop by town to see what’s left of Bacarra Tower that was declared a National Cultural Treasure. Instead of cleaning up the mess left by devastation, debris were left untouched which gave more character to Bacarra’s pride. Rather, walkways, plants, and trees, were added to beautify the the tower and the church across it.
